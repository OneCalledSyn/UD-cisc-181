Able to make 2-D arrays: int[][] arr2d = {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8},{9,10,11,12}};

    -int[][] arr2d = new int[a][b]; will give a 2-D array with a arrays each of b elements
    -Can have even higher dimension arrays
    -3D array is an array of 2D arrays
    -4D array could be used to store x/y/z/t coordinates

Accessors:

    -public instance methods that access private data (getters)
    -can return different forms of the data
    -Convention: getSomeProperty()
    -ex: getField

Mutators:

    -public instance methods that change private data
    -may change more than one private data element
    -Convention: setSomeProperty()
    -ex: setField

Static Variables and Methods:

    -independent of individual objects made from a class
    -everything else is specific to the particular object being created from the class
    -Static variables belong to a class, should be mostly used for constants to avoid bugs
    -Beginner mistake is to make everything static, try to have more flexibility
    -Static methods belong to a class as well, so they dont have access to object fields
    -Can't call nonstatic methods because those use object variables

Instance Variables and Methods:

    -Not static, instance variables belong to a specific instance
    -Instance methods are invoked by an instance if the class

Null Value:

    -If the data field of a reference type does not reference some object, the data field holds the special value null
