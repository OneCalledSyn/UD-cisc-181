    Sets

-A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
-No order (except TreeSets?)
-Set interface only contains method inherited from Collection, but not List
-NOT structured like lists
-Have to implement the method signatures in the Collection interface
-There is no "get" method since there is no order in a set

    Hash Set

-Used more frequently than TreeSet
-Faster than TreeSet for: contains, add, remove
    -Usually faster than lists as well
-NOT ordered
-Concept: take an object that we want to put in the set, use a hashing function on that object
    -This (hopefully) gives the object a unique index
    -Object is then placed at that unique index in an array
-A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size
-Goal is to be able to locate objects quickly
    -All objects that are equal should have the same index generated for them

    Tree Set

-Implements SortedSet interface, so despite being a set, it IS ordered
-Objects are stored in a sorted and ascending order
