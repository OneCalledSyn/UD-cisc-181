Array: data structure that is a collection of the same type of data
    -Fixed length list
    -Example: double [] myList = new double[10]; //Array containing 10 elements, indexed 0-9
        -new: Java keyword that creates the object (calls a constructor to initialize the array object)
        -Java is class based, so anything that isn't a primitive type (int, double, char) needs to be instantiated

Adavanced for loop: //for (T element:Collection obj/array)
//{
//    statement(s)
//}
    -Example: String array[] = {"Ron", "Harry", "Hermoine"};

        for (String x:array)
        {
            System.out.println(x);
        }
        //Ron, Harry, Hermione is the output

Java.util.Arrays is an import containing many useful methods for dealing with arrays (sort, binary search, fill, to string)

A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. When an object of a class is created, the constructor is called.

In Java, strings are IMMUTABLE.
    -Immutable classes cannot have their instances modified
    -Designed to be immutable for security and efficiency

Accessors are used to return the value of a private field

If you try to print an object without a toString() method, it will just print out the hash representation of the object
