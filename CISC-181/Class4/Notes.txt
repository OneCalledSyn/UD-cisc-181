Java is a true Object-Oriented language
    -All Java programs are structured by classes
    -A class serves as a template for an object
        -Classes behave like basic data types, contain definition for all objects of the same type
            -Defines the data types, names of properties, methods that define behavior; template for Object instances
EXAMPLE

class  ClassName    {
  [fields declaration]
  [methods declaration]
	}

Objects that lose their reference and cannot be used in the future become garbage collection candidates
Java periodically dumps garbage to free up memory

Encapsulation in Java is wrapping up data under a single unit
-Deals with making information public or private
-An object instance owns its state and behavior
-public: all code can access state and behavior
-private: only instances of the enclosing class can access state and behavior
-protected: stricter than public but less strict than private

General rule: All fields should be private, and methods should be private if possible
